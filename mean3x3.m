%%%%%%%%%%%%%  Function mean3x3 %%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
% Purpose:  
%      Compute a 3X3 mean (neighborhood average) filter at each pixel 
%           in an image 
%
% Input Variables:
%      f       MxN input 2D gray-scale image to be filtered
%      fzero   MxN image full of zeroes
%      M, N    rows (M) and columns (N) in f
%      x       x coordinate of a pixel
%      y       y coordinate of a pixel
%      xlo, xhi, ylo, yhi   Limits on what can be processed by filter
%      
% Returned Results:
%     mean     new image cantaining the filtered results
%
% Processing Flow:
%      1.  Set a new image full of ZEROS
%      2.  For each valid pixel,
%             compute the mean of the 3x3 neighborhood about the
%             pixel and assign this value to the mean image
%
%  Restrictions/Notes:
%      This function takes an 8-bit image as input.  
%
%  The following functions are called:
%      none

yhi = N-1; % Can't process last  row

% Compute the filtered output image
